One of my first independant projects with *Mosaic*, the 5 Ascent Contest was a contest entry site built in .NET. This site was part two of a Wrigley contest that also included a Gumergency contest website. This site gave me the chance to work with Less, a first (and last), as well as the opportunity to work within a .NET environment. The site was fully responsive and featured a carousel of 5 Gum product flavours.
