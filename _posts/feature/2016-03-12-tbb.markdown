The Business Builders is a project I worked on with a close friend of mine. As an opportunity to sharpen my design skills, I designed the branding and logo as well as the website, from the ground up. The website is built on top of CouchCMS and deployments were done through [DeployBot](http://deploybot.com/) (formerly dploy.io). The CSS is very modular, with the goal being to be able to reuse as much of it as possible.
