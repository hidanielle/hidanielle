I created Budgeter as another research project with Angular. This time, I was inspired by an excel sheet that calculated your monthly budgets. As I'm very new to Angular and front end frameworks in general, I figured it would be a fun, small project to try to recreate. Right now, the application won't store any information and is purely for demonstration. All of the totals add up immediately and update a piechart on the page to visually represent your budgets. This application was also one of my first times using purely Bootstrap for the front end design.
