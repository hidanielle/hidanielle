The [Economical Insurance](http://economical.com) corporate site is built within the *Kentico CMS* and is fully *accessible*. My first large site within a CMS, it was interesting wrapping my head around the challenges that come with building more modular components. I worked closely with another front end developer and back end developers to make each component accessible, including videos embedded in carousels, form elements with tooltips, and a large navigation 3 levels deep. With support for modern browsers only, I got to work a lot with *Flexbox* and fell in love with it. Within the CMS, the site is extremely flexible, giving clients many options for layout and configuration.
