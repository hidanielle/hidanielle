[Reel 2 Reel Podcast](http://reel2reel.org) is an excellent podcast about celebrities and movies and, most recently, includes a spin off series about The Bachelorette Canada, called Rose 2 Rose. I had the opportunity to build a quick site that aggregated the episodes and provided a global place for the creators to link out to. The site is set up using *Jekyll* for blogs and the *Soundcloud API* to pull in a list of recent episodes and a feature episode including description. It uses *flexbox* for layout and was designed by myself in the browser.

On top of the site, I was responsible for the general branding of the podcast, including creation of the logo and the caricatures!
