Countdown uses **local storage** and **moment.js** to count down to user-submitted events. I built this application while following the *Angular* tutorial in an effort to familiarize myself with the framework. The application takes multiple countdowns and lists them out. Each event has a feature page so that it can be bookmarked or, for example, set as a homepage. There are definitely kinks to work out, but overall I'm happy with the outcome and hope to use my free time to add-on to the application.
