Supported by the National Diabetes Trust, the Diabetes Canada Declutter program allows people to easily donate used household items, clothing, etc. by scheduling an at-home pick up or dropping off at one of thousands of donation bins across the country. 

Working closely with our client partners, our team at ecentricarts wanted to make the process of scheduling a pickup quick, easy, and accessible to everyone. We used storymapping to focus on key user tasks, took a mobile-first approach to wireframes, and thanks to the benefit of a headless CMS, started on the content modelling as soon as possible. 

The application is built on Kentico Cloud and Vue.js, integrating with Google Maps for the Find a Donation Bin functionality and client API's for scheduling. I was able to reuse custom Vue components that I had built in the past for a quicker turnaround and used ARIA to enhance the experience for users of assistive technology.
