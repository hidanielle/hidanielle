A respsonsive quiz microsite to help users learn how to read Nutrition Facts tables. Audited for *WCAG level AA* compliance. Had to be fully **keyboard accessible** as well. Nutrition Facts tables were built as live text using **Fittext** to help maintain proportions to look like a real Nutrition Facts table.
